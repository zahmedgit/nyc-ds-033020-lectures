1. Return the average list price for each brand.

2. Return the product_name, the brand_name, list price, and assign an integer 
to each product (restarting with each brand) by list_price descending.

3. Return the highest priced item for each brand (do not worry if more than one item is the most expensive). 
Use one of the strategies we went over earlier.
