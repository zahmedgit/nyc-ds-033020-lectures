    "# Classification Bake-off:\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this bake off if for students to practice the data science process and handling . Through this process, you will need to clean and prepare the data, engineer features, fit didfferent models, tune the hyperparameters of those models, and account for how any class imbalance can affect your model. \n",

    "## Data Set Information:\n",
    "\n",
    "This dataset contains information about customers' credit card default payments in Taiwan. It was taken from a study that compares the predictive accuracy of probability of default among six data mining methods. This data set is not as clean as some of the data you have previously recieved. Below is all of the information that is given about the different columns of data. As you explore this data you will find that the 'data dictionary' below does not include all of the values that you will find in the actual dataset. You will have to make decisions on your own as to how you will interpret and handle these unknown values.  \n",
